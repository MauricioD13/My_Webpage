I'm an electronic engineer who graduated from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogot√°, Colombia. During the 5 years of the career, I realized that my passion was more focused to the pure digital world with programming and digital infrastructure, and not with the circuits, but despite this realization, I also appreciate all the knowledge about electronics because has became easier learn new things about programming, Linux, cloud, to mentions a few.

One of my hobby is voleyball and it's a sport that gave me a lot of friends and experiences that made me a better human being. Some of the things that I could highlight are:

- Team work: Understanding 
Vista en Odoo version 15:pend to a certain point of my presence in the training.

- Consistency: When I start training with the university team, I wasn't the best by far, but through all the experiences and years of training, I ended being a regular player in the matches. Trust the process.

When I started a job, I had the fortune of working with an excellent team and a great boss who allowed me to learn more in 5 months than in 2 years of college. After three months of working, for some coincidences, the boss assigned me in an assesment of a major client, and being a junior consultant, I had the responsability of evaluate some requirements with managers of the company, and because I was in good company with one colleage of the team I learn a lot and performed pretty well.

After that job, I want to expand my knowledge and understaning of the world, so I searched for a master program outside of Colombia and found the opportunity to come to Madrid, Spain to study a master in cybersecurity, where I learned a lot and realized that I like AWS cloud more that I had initially thought, and learned about a very interesting concept called DevSecOps. Those new things, gave me the motivation to learn Terraform and Ansible for process automation and provision.

To be continue...
